is a fictional character in the anime series _Ghost in the Shell: Stand
Alone Complex_. The Laughing Man logo is an
animated image of a smiling figure wearing a cap, with circling text quoting a 
line from Salinger's novel _The Catcher in the Rye_, which reads:

> "I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes."
